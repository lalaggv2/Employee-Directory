as a 'user', i wasnt to be able to view my entire 'employee directory' at once so that I have quick access to their information

The user shoudl be able to sort the 'table' by alt least one 'category' and 'filter' the 'users' by at least one 'property'

## objects
* User
*Employee Directory
* User info
* Table
* Category
* Filter
* Property

## Components
* Header
* filter
* Table
  *Properties (the talbe headers)
  * Data ('User's' records)


  Usar randomuser or json placeholder para obtener records de users
